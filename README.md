## Mobile application for price comparison - flutter framework.

1. The project involves the creation of a multi-platform (Android and iOS) application that allows users to check the average price of products in a given country.
  - Later, the implementation of the function of reviewing opinions of other users about products and the possibility of adding opinions by registered users is expected.

2. The main users of the program are tourists as well as people temporarily staying in another country, e.g. students.

3. Currently, application testing will focus on the Android version.
